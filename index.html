                    And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine<br>
                    But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now<br>
                    Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself<br>
                    And I don't wanna be somebody in America, <br>
                    Just fighting the hysteria<br>
                    I only wanna die someday<br><br><br>
                    Someday, someday<br>
                    When I burst into flames<br>
                    I'll leave you the dust, my love<br>
                    Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the<br>
                    Days when we came to this place<br>
                    I told you I'd spill my guts, I left you to clean it up<br>

                    Seems like now it's impossible to work this out<br>
                    I'm so committed to an old ghost town<br>
                    Is it really that strange if I always want a change?<br>
                    And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely<br>
                    I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces<br>

                    Who will fill the empty space? Oh<br><br><br>
                    And now, if I figure this out<br>
                    Apart from my beatin' heart<br>
                    It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the<br>
                    Weight of the choices I've made<br>
                    I told you I'd ride this out<br>

                    Too many guys think I'm a concept, or<br>
                    I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive<br>
                    I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own piece of mind<br>

                    Ignoring every warning sign<br>
                    Come on and make me feel alright again<br><br><br>
                    'Cause it's 3am<br>
                    And I'm calling everybody that I know<br>
                    And here we go again<br>
                    While I'm running through the numbers in my phone<br>
                    And yeah I'll take fake moans and dial tones<br>
                    Let 'em spill right down the microphone<br>
                    I need it digital<br>
                    'Cause, baby, when it's physical<br>
                    I end up alone, end up alone<br><br><br>
                    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
                    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>

                    I end up alone, end up alone<br><br><br>
                    Every night I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen<br>
                    I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans<br>
                    I know it's complicated 'cause everyone that I've dated<br>
                    Says they hate it 'cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me<br>
                    Know that my identity's always gettin' the best of me<br>
                    I'm the worst of my enemies and I don't really know what to do with me<br>
                    Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me<br><br><br>
                    I keep on hangin' on the line<br>
                    Ignoring every warning sign<br>
                    Come on and make me feel alright again<br><br><br>

                    Take a different version and I try it on for size<br>
                    With everybody that I know<br>
                    And will you please pick up the fucking phone?<br><br><br>
